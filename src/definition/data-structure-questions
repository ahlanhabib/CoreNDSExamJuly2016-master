Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans: we need data structure to be efficient in terms of time and memory when processing
     large data and solving complex math problem

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans: Array, ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, HashMap, HasTable, Graph and many more.

what is an Array?
Ans: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Array is fixed, same type data, hard to use in real time database work.
     ArrayList is dynamic, Grow-able, memory and time saving.

what is LinkedList?
Ans: A linked list is a linear dynamic data structure where each element is a separate object
     and that can grow and shrink during itâ€™s execution time.

what is queue?
Ans: A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) where data are inserted and removed using the principle FIFO.

what is stack?
Ans: A stack is a container of objects where data are inserted and removed using the principle LIFO.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: First-in & First-out (FIFO)
     Last-in & First-out (LIFO)

what is the order of complexity?
Ans: Order of complexity measures how many steps it takes to complete a problem in certain way in data structure

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans: The best case is when the case is present in the first location searched

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans: The worst case is when searched case is not present in the data set

what is tree in data structure?
Ans: A tree is a data structure consisting of nodes organized as a hierarchy

what is graph in data structure?
Ans: A graph is an array comprised of a set of vertices and a set of edges

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans: HashMap is non synchronized and not thread safe.On the other hand, HashTable is thread safe and synchronized

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans: RDBMS - Array,
     Network data model - Graph
     and Hierarchical data model - Trees

How HashMap works in java?
Ans: HashMap works on the principle of hashing

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is an exception that causes the program crash. If we call an array index that is not
created yet at that time ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException happens.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans: Using addAll, int[] newArray= new int[oldArray1+oldArray2];

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: ArrayList internally uses dynamic array to store the elements.
     LinkedList internally uses doubly linked list to store the elements.

     Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses array. If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.
     Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses doubly linked list so no bit shifting is required in memory.

     ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.
     LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.

     ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data. LinkedList is better for manipulating data.

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search) are search algorithms used for graphs and trees.

What is Recursion?
Ans: Recursion is a basic programming technique, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem. A method that uses
     this technique is recursive.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: Big O notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Ans: Merged sort is better at dealing with large data compared to insertion sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
